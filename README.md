# Helyx-Submission
Hack the Helyx submission

Our project is a website which aim is to allow everyone interested in environmental sustainability to know 
the amount of energy they are able to get from a solar panel depending on the day and the place where they are. 

In our region it is always extremely sunny, and as a result, we thought that solar radiation could be a great 
point to take into account when trying to make this one more ecological, cleaner and, in conclusion, more sustainable. 

Since this is just a prototype, we only have been able to get data from local weather stations, which we obtained from IMIDA, the Institute for Agrarian and Food Research and Development from Murcia, Spain. 

All this data can be found in the data folder. There are 27 csv files, and each one corresponds to a weather station in the region, containing more than 6 thousands of lines of code.
